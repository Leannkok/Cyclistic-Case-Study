## **GOOGLE CAPSTONE PROJECT 1 - CYCLISTIC**

The purpose of this project is to determine the difference between member and casual bike riders for this company called Cyclistic, a bike sharing company in Chicago. 
I have cleaned and analyzed the data using Python and used Tableau to visualize the data for a better understanding. I have also proposed marketing strategies which can be found below for the purpose of converting casual riders to become members.

### **Background**
Cyclistic was founded back in 2016 and is a bike sharing program which features 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station anytime. Up to now, Cyclistic's marketing strategy mainly relies on building general awareness and an appeal which targets broad consumer segments. One of the strategies includes having flexbile pricing plans such as single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships.
