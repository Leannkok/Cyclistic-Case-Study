## **GOOGLE CAPSTONE PROJECT 1 - CYCLISTIC**

The purpose of this project is to determine the difference between member and casual bike riders for this company called Cyclistic, a bike sharing company in Chicago. 
I have cleaned and analyzed the data using Python and used Tableau to visualize the data for a better understanding. I have also proposed marketing strategies which can be found below for the purpose of converting casual riders to become members.
