## **GOOGLE CAPSTONE PROJECT 1 - CYCLISTIC**

The purpose of this project is to determine the difference between member and casual bike riders for this company called Cyclistic, a bike sharing company in Chicago. 
I have cleaned and analyzed the data using Python and used Tableau to visualize the data for a better understanding. I have also proposed marketing strategies which can be found below for the purpose of converting casual riders to become members.

### **Background**
Cyclistic was founded back in 2016 and is a bike sharing program which features 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station anytime. Up to now, Cyclistic's marketing strategy mainly relies on building general awareness and an appeal which targets broad consumer segments. One of the strategies includes having flexbile pricing plans such as single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. The riders that purchase single-ride passes or full-day passes can be categorized as *casual riders* while riders that purchase annual memberships are categorized as Cyclistic *members*.

The purpose of this case study is to come up with marketing strategies that could convert casual riders into annual members. Additionally, the question that I will be mainly addressing for this case study would be: </br> "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"

[for Tableau](https://github.com/Leannkok/Cyclistic-Case-Study/blob/main/forTableau.py) - prepared the data so it can be uploaded to Tableau Public for visualization

[Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jia.qian5404/viz/GoogleCapstoneProject-CyclisticCaseStudy/Dashboard1) - used Figma to create the background and Tableau to create the dashboard

### **Finished Project**

#### **1. Type of Riders**
Members had the most amount of rides, contributing to approximately 55% of total rides.

#### **2. Bike Type**
Among the 3 types of bikes, classic bike was the most popular bike for both casual riders and members. Furthermore, members were found to only rode around with classic bikes and electric bikes unlike casual riders.

#### **3. Total Rides by Months**
July, Auguest and September were observed to be the busiest months for both type of riders. Additionally, we can also conclude that Summer (June - August) was the busiest season with July having the most rides. 

#### **4. Total Rides by Weeks**
As compared to weekdays, weekends were observed to be busier with Saturday being the busiest day of the week. The number of rides contributed from members are consistent throughout the week with a slight increase during weekends. On the other hand, the number of rides contributed from casual riders can be observed to have a more significant increase during weekends. Additionally, it can be observed that there are more members as compared to casual riders during weekdays.

#### **5. Total Rides by Hours**
4pm - 6pm were the busiest time with casual riders having more rides. 5pm was the busiest hour for both casual riders and annual members. 

### **Suggestions**
* Offer a weekend-only membership at a lower price point than the normal annual membership to attract casual riders as analysis showed that there are more casual riders during the weekend and also run more campaigns targeting weekends
* Run more campaigns during Summer as it was the busiest season among the 4 seasons
* Encourage existing members to share their experiences on using Cyclistic's membership system and offer a special discount for the ones that shared. A space with all the experiences shared will in turn encourage new riders especially frequent casual riders to join as members. 
* Offer a special discount from 4pm - 6pm often just for members only to entice casual riders to become members so they can also enjoy the special discount
